I was suppose to make a quiz of multiple choices.
I was suppose to make a timer that counts down and if you answer the question wrong it would have taken some time off the clock.
I needed a screen shot of the homework
I got stuck at changing the word question to a question and having the quiz load up the multiple choices of answers.
I was suppose to keep score also.
Apprently I didnt get far. :(
    will request a regrade
