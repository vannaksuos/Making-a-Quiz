The quiz starts out with a start button
once start button is clicked, it triggers the countdown timer and a question container appear with multiple choices answers.
An answer must be selected before the next set of question and answers appear.
If you select an incorrect answer you will lose time off the timer.
If you answer correctly you will receive points towards your score.
When the timer is out of time the game will end and your score will appear.
If you answered all the question before the timer runs out of time and hit the finish button the game is over and score will appear.
I need to save user initial and high score, its not exactly how I want it but it will do for now.
